# organ-segmentation-using-UNET-Deep-learning-
Welcome to our UNet project repository! UNet is a powerful deep learning model used for semantic segmentation tasks, and in this project, we've applied it to medical image analysis. Dive into our code to see how we're leveraging UNet to perform precise organ segmentation, advancing healthcare through state-of-the-art AI technology.

the jupyter notebook consist of the UNET model code with training and testing scripts.
1. In our image segmentation project, we utilize a .mat file format to store essential data, such as color maps or additional annotations, required for the segmentation process. (MOS.mat).
